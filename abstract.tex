Gridcoin [6] is a decentralized, open source math-based digital asset (cryptocurrency) which performs transactions peer-to-peer cryptographically without the need for a central issuing authority.
Gridcoin securely rewards volunteer distributed computing performed upon the BOINC [5] platform in a decentralized manner on top of proof of stake. Projects range from attempting to cure diseases to searching for extraterrestrial life! 

This whitepaper describes how Gridcoin makes it possible to reward running scientific simulations with cryptocurrency in a completely decentralized way. Gridcoin is heavily based on Bitcoin [1], although Proof of Work is replaced with the novel approach of Proof of Stake [2] linked to Proof of Research [3]. The voting mechanism embedded in the blockchain which allows to choose which scientific projects to include in Proof of Research is outlined. In conclusion, an outlook is given on how Gridcoin could complement the way science is funded, sparking competition between traditionally funded science and gridcoin funded science.
